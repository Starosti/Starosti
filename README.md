# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ã‡aÄŸan Atan!

I'm a software engineer based in **Ä°zmir, Turkey**, with a strong focus on transforming complex data into meaningful and interactive web experiences. My background spans software engineering, data visualization, UI/UX design, and digital creativity.

I specialize in building performant, accessible, and visually engaging interfaces using modern web technologies. 

## My Current Focus Area: Web-based Performant Data Visualization

I have developed and contributed to various projects involving interactive data visualizations. My work centers around clarity, interactivity, and usability. My primary tools for building these experiences include:

- **D3.js** -> Custom SVG and DOM visualizations
- **Sigma.js** -> Interactive network and graph visualizations
- **Chart.js** -> Quick and efficient charting for dashboards
- **TanStack Table** -> High performance tabular data interfaces

With a strong foundation in React and it's most popular libraries, I love turning ideas into reality through intuitive and engaging user interfaces.
